  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>The study of galaxy formation throughout history has played a huge role in not only understanding our own galaxy, but the structure of the universe itself, with some of the earliest galaxies being formed around 300-400 million years ago after the Big Bang (Williams, 2025). Furthermore, it’s study has been linked to other important concepts in physics, such as dark matter, 
    a substance that makes up about 85% of the universe’s matter and attracts visible matter such as gas and stars to form galaxies (sutter, 2022). 
    Regarding galaxy formation, its study has enabled scientists to explain the factors that contribute to it, such as galaxy collisions, which are capable of either tearing galaxies apart or merging them into larger galaxies (Sabia, 2023). 
    Researchers from the university of Leiden have recently developed a hydrodynamical simulation known as FLAMINGO to study galaxy formation, a computational model that uses mathematical equations to study how particles interact with each other. Bearing in mind the implications of the findings of this model, 
    this paper aims to evaluate the use of hydrodynamical models in studying galaxy formation (Joop Schaye, 2023). To begin with, the figures and the galaxy measurements produced by FLAMINGO as well as its accuracy will be discussed and followed by an assessment of its strengths and weaknesses and its potential future applications.  
    Moreover, potential improvements to the model will be considered.
